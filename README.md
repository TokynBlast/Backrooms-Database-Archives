# Backrooms-Database-Archives
This is in Beta, I am working on this very hard, atleast 15 new items are added every week
## Searching
Here is a basic guideline for searching for things. Levels, entities, and objects are all searched the same way, and as a group are represented as `loe`
* There are no special characters (e.g., periods)
* When searching, you don't start with 'the'
* __LOE__ is searched as __LOE 1__
* logs are log 001, log 011, or log 111
* To add a file, you can open the write.py file
##Extra
This Backrooms Archive Database allows you to view images, and lets you make youre own level, using the specially designed tex editor I made, called "clodBlex"
