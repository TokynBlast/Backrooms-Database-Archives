## Searching
Here is a basic guideline for searching for things. Levels, entities, and objects are all searched the same way, and as a group are represented as `LOE`
* There are no special characters (e.g., periods)
* When searching, you don't start with 'the'
* __LOE__ is searched as __LOE 1__
* logs are log 001, log 011, or log 111
* To add a file, you can open the write.py file or type in a file that doesnt yet exist, then type y and press enter, this will open the ClobDex editor

## v1.5 (current)
Version 1.5 removes the need for the external librarys (except for tKinker)

Removal of regular use templates in ClobDex

## v1.6 (next update)
Version 1.6 will combine the Clobdex editor and other files into one file, for less complications, some other things are:

more middle and last names

More functions in ClobDex

Fixed templates in ClobDex

Fixed generation in ClobDex

## Extra
This Backrooms Archive Database allows you to view images, and lets you make youre own level, using the specially designed tex editor I made, called "cloBdex"
